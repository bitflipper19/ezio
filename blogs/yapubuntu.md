# My Experience with Linux Distros

My Linux journey started way before I even knew what an "OS" really meant.

## 🎒 The Edubuntu Days

Back in school, our computer lab ran on **Edubuntu**. It had a friendly interface, colorful icons, and came loaded with fun apps like **Tux Paint** and **GCompris**. I didn't know much about operating systems back then, but it looked different, felt smooth, and just... made sense. That was my first brush with Linux — even if I didn’t realize it at the time.

## 💾 Reviving an Old Laptop (2022)

Fast forward to 2022 — I had an old laptop lying around, painfully slow with Windows. Instead of tossing it, I gave it a second life with **Arch Linux + Xfce**.

Getting it installed was half the adventure:
- Downloaded the ISO
- Flashed it using **Rufus**
- Booted from a USB
- Followed an Arch install guide step-by-step (and prayed along the way 😅)

But man, the payoff was sweet. The system was super lightweight, used barely any RAM on boot, and Xfce felt snappy even on old hardware. It was the first time I truly understood the power of Linux — lean, modular, and fully mine to customize.

## 🖥️ Dual Boot to Hyprland Life

When I got my new laptop, I started with the safe route — **dual-booting Ubuntu with Windows 11**. It worked well, and I appreciated the out-of-the-box experience Ubuntu provides. But soon, I wanted more control and a cleaner, bloat-free system.

So I went all in: wiped everything and installed **Arch Linux** again — but this time with **Hyprland** as the window manager. The tiling workflow, slick animations, and lightweight setup felt perfect. It wasn’t just an OS anymore — it felt like home.

### 🚀 Things I Learned Along the Way

- How bootloaders and partitions work
- The beauty of the Linux file system
- That fixing a broken Arch install at 2AM is both terrifying and satisfying

Linux distros have taught me more about computers than any textbook ever could. From playing Tux Paint in school to managing dotfiles with pride, it’s been one hell of a ride — and I’m not switching back anytime soon. 😄

**Arch btw.**
