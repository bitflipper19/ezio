# Competitive Programming – Most NPC Comp Sci Rabbit Hole  
27 July, 2025

## What is competitive programming?

This term, as you can probably guess, is made up of two words: *competitive* and *programming*. “Competitive” comes from the part where you're locked in a digital arena with thousands of other keyboard warriors, and you’re all trying to outperform each other. And “programming”, well, that’s the part where you try to explain to a machine what to do, using your barely-held-together brute force logic.

You're supposed to solve 5-6 (sometimes even more, if the problem setters were feeling particularly evil) algorithmic puzzles in around 2 hours. The problems increase in difficulty — starting with “Hey, I got this!” and ending with “Did I accidentally open a quantum physics exam?”. These problems involve math, data structures, algorithms, and the occasional existential crisis. Based on how many you solve and how fast, you get a **rating**. And let’s be honest, we all pretend we don’t care about the rating... until it drops.

Popular battlegrounds for CP (that’s what the cool kids call it) include **Codeforces**, **Atcoder**, **Codechef**, **Leetcode contests**, and **TopCoder**.


## So how did I fall into this rabbit hole?

First of all, I didn't fell into it, CP presented itself as a known-stranger in IIIT Allahabad. It's a norm here to grind CP and people literally consider you irrelevent if you don't do. I gave my first contest in august 2024, only one week into college. I remember, It took me a significant amount of time to figure out wtf was the UI of codechef and how do you solve and run a code. My rating in the very first contest fell by 110 or so, I was in 890s, started at the default rating of 1000. Pledged that in the next contest, I'll prepare well, and outperform everyone in the college (atleast first years). Did the time come? **No**, gave my second contest 3 months later, ~~weekly contest btw~~, and performed okay-ish. First semester ended, I gave only two contests, ~~many of my batchmates were already 3* (no lifers) coders~~. Sem 1 ends.

Sem 2 starts, we had a course named Data Structures and Algorithms, starting classes were boring until sorting algorithms walked in, I was fascinated that how a bunch (probably in the order of 10^5) of transistors sorted a list of numbers and how's there a race to make it fast. Computers, unlike us, don't just look at the list and start arranging them. I started taking interest into the thought process behind making computers do this efficiently, and realised this is what CP is about. 

I started giving contests, solving the problems and learning


## LLMs and the Great Cheater Uprising

Ah yes, the **LLM (Large Language Model) apocalypse**. These days, you can't enter a contest without wondering if the guy who submitted the solution in 12 seconds is:
- a prodigy  
- using ChatGPT  
- or both (help.)

Competitive programming used to be a test of logic, speed, and stubbornness. Now it’s slowly turning into a Turing test. Some platforms have responded with stricter anti-cheat measures, but let's be real — if someone wants to cheat, they will. But they’ll just hurt themselves long-term. You can't copy-paste your way through an actual interview. Or life.


## So... how to get better at CP (without becoming a cheater)?

If you're genuinely interested and not just here because your friends told you it's "good for placements", here’s what worked (or at least, helped me survive):

- **Start with easy problems.** No shame. You’re learning, not trying to flex.
- **Practice consistently.** Like gym but for your brain — and yes, it’s leg day every day.
- **Upsolve after contests.** The pain of "almost got it" is a good teacher.
- **Learn patterns.** 2-pointer, binary search, dp, dfs/bfs... they come up *a lot*. Learn them well.
- **Don’t stare at a problem for 4 hours.** If you’re stuck, look at the editorial after a fair fight.
- **Join a community.** Discord, Telegram, whatever. CP is less painful when you share the pain.


## How to think like a machine (almost)?

Okay, jokes aside — machines don’t “think”. They *follow instructions perfectly*. So to think like a machine, you must:
- Break down problems into tiny, mechanical steps.
- Handle **every** condition — especially edge cases.
- Be emotionless when debugging (but internally crying is fine).
- Simulate inputs in your head like you're the interpreter.
- Write code like you're explaining it to a robot with zero context.

The closer your thought process is to precise instructions, the fewer "Why is it not working?!" moments you'll have.


## Final words?

CP is frustrating, annoying, and occasionally rage-inducing. But it’s also incredibly satisfying when you *finally* pass that last test case. Whether you're doing it to become a better problem solver, prep for interviews, or just farm rating, remember — it's a game. And like every game, it's okay to lose sometimes.

Just don’t let the leaderboard mess with your head. You’re not a failure if you can’t solve 4 problems in 2 hours. You’re just... human. Not GPT-8, which is trained on 1000s of such problems (and still struggles sometimes).

Happy coding, and may your submissions be AC and your bugs be few
