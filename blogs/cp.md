# Competitive Programming – Most NPC Comp Sci Rabbit Hole  
27 July, 2025

## What is competitive programming?

This term, as you can probably guess, is made up of two words: *competitive* and *programming*. “Competitive” comes from the part where you're locked in a digital arena with thousands of other keyboard warriors, and you’re all trying to outperform each other. And “programming”, well, that’s the part where you try to explain to a machine what to do, using your barely-held-together brute force logic, cuz most people simply can't optimize.

You're supposed to solve 5-6 (sometimes even more, if the problem setters were feeling particularly evil) algorithmic puzzles in around 2 hours. The problems increase in difficulty — starting with ~~1 CPA kahi nahi gaya~~ and ending with ~~ab toh CHWTIA company bhi chalegi~~. These problems involve math, data structures, algorithms, and the occasional existential crisis. Based on how many you solve and how fast, you get a **rating**. And let’s be honest, we all pretend we don’t care about the rating... until it drops.

Popular battlegrounds for CP (that’s what the cool ~~kids~~ call it) include **Codeforces**, **Atcoder**, **Codechef**, **Leetcode contests**, and **TopCoder**.


## So how did I fall into this rabbit hole?

First of all, I didn't fell into it, CP presented itself as a known-stranger in IIIT Allahabad. It's a norm here to grind CP. I Gave my first contest in august 2024, only one week into college. I remember, It took me a significant amount of time to figure out wtf was the UI of codechef and how do you solve and run a code. My rating in the very first contest fell by 110 or so, I was in 890s, started at the default rating of 1000. Pledged that in the next contest, I'll prepare well, and outperform everyone in the college (atleast first years). Did the time come? **No**, gave my second contest 3 months later, ~~weekly contest btw~~, and performed okay-ish. First semester ended, I gave only two/three contests, ~~many of my batchmates were already 3* (no lifers) coders~~. Sem 1 ends!!

Sem 2 starts, we had a course named *Data Structures and Algorithms*, starting classes were boring until sorting algorithms walked in, I was fascinated that how a bunch (probably in the order of 10^5) of transistors sorted a list of numbers and how's there a race to make it fast. Computers, unlike us, don't just look at the list and start arranging them. I started taking interest into the thought process behind making computers do this efficiently, and realised this is what CP is about. 

I started giving contests, solving the problems and learning algorithms and optimisation techniques. Did okay-ish and reached 3* :p and Pupil :p.

## So... how to get better at CP (without becoming a cheater)?



## How to think like a machine (almost)?




## Final words?
